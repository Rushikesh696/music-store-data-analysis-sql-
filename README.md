# Music Store Data Analysis using SQL

### Project Overview
This project involves designing a database for a digital Music Store and running a series of analytical SQL queries to extract meaningful business insights. The dataset represents a fictional music store with information about customers, employees, tracks, invoices, genres, and more.

The goal of the project is to answer real-world business questions using SQL, helping stakeholders make informed decisions such as identifying top customers, understanding buying behavior, and planning promotions.

#### Technologies Used
SQL (MySQL syntax)

Database: Structured relational database using tables and foreign key relationships

#### Database Schema
The following tables were created and used:

albums

artist

customer

employee

genre

invoice

invoice_line

media_type

playlist

playlist_track

track

Each table stores a specific entity, and they are related via foreign keys to allow normalized and efficient queries.
